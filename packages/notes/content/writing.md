title: Writing
---

- I inculcated a writing habit long and actually enjoy the process of it. This has resulted in start my blog and it also provided me a lot of insights. Let me tell you what are the goals when I start writing.
  - To explain something
    - This led to all the blog posts. I like to explain things that I understand. And while writing the posts, I understand them even more clearly.
  - To think through
    - I didn't know this was possible until I started writing. In the early days, I would start writing each morning allowing myself to dump things out of my brain. So with this, I could arrange my thoughts (and hopefully decide on something) and I could let my mind be free. You can't think through clearly when the mind is already full.^^ Imagine you are pouring coffee in cup which is already full with coffee.^^ It can't take anymore coffee, right?
