title: Writing
---

I inculcated a writing habit long and actually enjoy the process of it. This has resulted in starting my [blog](https://aravindballa.com/writings) and it also provided me a lot of insights. There are mainly 2 goals to my writing.

### To explain something

This led to all the blog posts. I like to explain things that I understand. And while writing the posts, I understand them even more clearly.

### To think through

I didn't know this was possible until I started writing. In the early days, I would start writing each morning allowing myself to dump things out of my brain. So with this, I could arrange my thoughts (and hopefully decide on something) and I could let my mind be free. You can't think through clearly when the mind is already full. <span class="highlight">Imagine you are pouring coffee in a cup which is already full with coffee.</span> It can't take anymore coffee, right?
