title: Books in Playground Outdoors, Manali

I'm at [[Playground Outdoors, Manali]], a coworking hostel in the Himalayas, and there is a shelf of good books here. I plan to pick few books and skim through them for ideas. This would also help me build my to-read list.

## Let my people go surfing

- Acknowledges the ideas that you should micro manage people.
- A group of ants don't have a hierarchy but they know what each ant should do.
- On culture
    - Encourages hiring people with different interests and outdoor hobbies. That adds more to the company than one who studied B school and knows only the bookish ways.
    - A skier knows when it's the right time to ski and surfer know when its right time to surf. So we should allow people to go do that when its the right time and work when its right for them.
- Right skill + passionate about the product they are building = right hire. Not just the one who knows how to do the job.
