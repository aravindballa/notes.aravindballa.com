title: About these notes
---

Hi, I'm [Aravind Balla](https://aravindballa.com) 👋

These are the scattered and unfinished version of my thoughts that run in my head.🏃 Have a sneak peak into my brain. These notes don't have an index of all the things I write, so keep clicking through the things you find interesting. And if a note resembles with you, please let me know. If you strongly. disagree in a note, they you should tell me for sure. Send me a [direct message](https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=532906019) on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/aravindballa) or an [email](mailto:bsaaravind@gmail.com) and we can talk.

I'm getting into the habit of [[Writing]] again, and as a result, I have a few notes lying around in [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/) and [Notion](https://www.notion.so/?r=3102f5265a104fcab0afd4ec98f0c9dc).

Present areas of focus are

- Day job
- [[Learning Curve]] podcast
- Creating content
